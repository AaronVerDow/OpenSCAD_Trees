# Variables

## seed
Setting a seed value will generate a tree with random effects but it will be fixed.  Every unique number should make a new tree.  The same seed will generate the same tree.  Setting to 0 will create a random tree every time and there will be no way to capture the output.

## levels
How many levels to create.
![](animations/output/levels_demo.gif)

## randomness
Multipler for all randomizers.  Setting to 0 will disable all randomizers.

## spread
Base spread of child branches.

![](animations/output/spread_many.gif)

## spread_variance
How much to allow random rolls to impact angle of child branches.

## angle_cutoff
This will limit the maximum angle a branch can go.  If this is exceeded no children are spawned.

## height
Height of the first branch.
![](animations/output/height_demo.gif)

## height_divider
Determines how much smaller children branches are.

## height_variance
How much the height randomenss roll will impact the height divider.

## root
Diameter of base of first branch.

## taper
Difference between the diameter at the base of the branch and the diameter at the tip.

## taper_variance
How much to allow random rolls to impact taper.
